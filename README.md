<h1>Bin to text</h1>
<p>python_bin_to_text.py contains a short python script to converty binary input into hexadecimal and readable text. I wrote it to gain some familiarity with pyhton, knowing that plenty of better tools for this task already exist. I plan to expand on it as time goes on to allow it to accept input in ascii, hexadecimal, or binary and output the other two formats. It is currently referencing .txt files which have the correlations between binary, hex, and ascii characters. It breaks if the binary input is not a multiple of 8, which is a bug I plan to fix in the coming weeks. While not a robust binary conversion software, it did indeed help me improve my familiarity with python.</p>
